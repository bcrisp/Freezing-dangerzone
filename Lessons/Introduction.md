Hello! Welcome to first day setup. In order to begin developing applications in Scala or Java, you'll need three things:

* Typesafe Activator: https://www.typesafe.com/get-started
* Java SE Development Kit 8u51: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* IntelliJ IDEA 14.1 Community Edition: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

These are all free pieces of software so there's nothing to buy. Some products, like IntelliJ IDEA, offer free "Community" and paid "Ultimate" editions, but in this class we'll be fine with the community resources and let your future employer pick up the tab on professional editions.
